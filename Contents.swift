//Intention: I would like to create a piece of code that would take each scholar's name and output each name into a string.
//Data types involved: Strings

//var name = "Sabyatha"
//var name1 = "Nailah"
//
//print("Hi \(name) and \(name1)! We are so happy you're here at KWK Portland!")

//Intention: Working with integers and doubles
//Data Types: Ints and Doubles

var int = 4
var double = 5.0

print(Double(int) * double)

var a = 12.4
var b = 65.0
var c = 31.0
var d = 98

print(((a + b + c) + Double(d))/4)
